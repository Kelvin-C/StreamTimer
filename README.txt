It is used to capture specific times of a video during video capture.
It can also be used as a timer to create lap times.

HOW TO USE:

To use VideoTimer, run VideoTimer.exe and the program will show you how to use it.

All of the configurations are in the config.ini file. You can modify it for your own use. However, do NOT touch the file before your first run.
There are restrictions in place to prevent the program from being corrupted. Nevertheless, changing the config.ini file completely will corrupt VideoTimer.
